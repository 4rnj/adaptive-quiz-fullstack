# Multi-Source Adaptive Quiz Application - Design Documentation

## Project Overview

A comprehensive multi-source quiz application built on AWS serverless architecture, featuring advanced adaptive learning algorithms with immediate wrong answer re-asking and intelligent progress tracking.

## üéØ Core Features

### Multi-Source Session Management
- **Hierarchical Selection**: Category ‚Üí Provider ‚Üí Certificate ‚Üí Resource configuration
- **Source Combination**: Mix different providers, languages, and quantities in single session
- **Session Persistence**: Save and restore complex session configurations
- **Real-time Progress**: Live tracking with penalty indicators for wrong answers

### Adaptive Learning Engine
- **Immediate Re-asking**: Wrong answers trigger immediate re-asking with shuffled choices
- **Wrong Answer Pool**: Timestamp-based tracking requiring 2 additional correct answers for mastery
- **Intelligent Selection**: 20% from oldest wrong answers, 80% random from remaining pool
- **Progressive Mastery**: Reset logic when wrong pool questions are answered incorrectly again

### Enhanced Progress Tracking
- **Main Progress**: "Question 7 / 60" display with percentage completion
- **Penalty Indicators**: "(+1 Question @ 2 Tries)" dynamic updates
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Performance metrics and learning pattern analysis
- **Multi-language Support**: English and German with language-specific serving

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

## üéì Adaptive Learning Details

### Algorithm Overview
1. **Question Selection**: 20% oldest wrong answers, 80% random from remaining pool
2. **Wrong Answer Processing**: Immediate re-asking with shuffled answer choices
3. **Mastery Tracking**: Requires 2 additional correct answers after initial wrong answer
4. **Reset Logic**: Wrong pool questions reset to 2 tries if answered incorrectly again

### Progress Indicators
- **Current Question**: "Question 7 / 60"
- **Additional Questions**: "(+1 Question @ 2 Tries)" when questions added to wrong pool
- **Completion Percentage**: Real-time calculation including penalty questions
- **Performance Analytics**: Success rates, learning velocity, subject mastery

## üåê Multi-Language Support

### Supported Languages
- **English (EN)**: Primary language with full feature support
- **German (DE)**: Complete localization including questions and UI
- **Extensible**: Framework supports additional languages

### Language Features
- Language-specific question pools
- Localized user interface
- Cultural adaptation for content
- Language mixing within sessions

## üí∞ Cost Optimization
